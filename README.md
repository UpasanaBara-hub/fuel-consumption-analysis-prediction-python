# Fuel Consumption Prediction of Vehicles (Python)

## Problem Statement
Fuel consumption is a critical factor in vehicle efficiency, cost management, and environmental impact. Accurately understanding the factors that influence fuel consumption helps manufacturers, policymakers, and consumers make informed decisions.  
This project addresses the problem of analyzing vehicle characteristics to identify key factors affecting fuel consumption and to develop a data-driven approach for estimating fuel efficiency.

---

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze vehicle specification data to identify significant factors influencing fuel consumption and to apply analytical techniques to predict fuel efficiency based on these characteristics.

---

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains vehicle-level information, including:
- Engine and mechanical specifications  
- Vehicle weight and performance attributes  
- Fuel consumption metrics  

The dataset was explored to understand relationships between vehicle features and fuel efficiency.

---

## Tools and Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Predictive Modeling (Regression-based approach)

---

## Data Preparation
The following preprocessing steps were performed:
- Validation of missing values and data consistency  
- Handling of outliers in numerical features  
- Feature scaling and transformation where required  
- Selection of relevant variables for modeling  

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The analysis focused on:
- Distribution of fuel consumption across vehicle categories  
- Relationships between engine size, weight, horsepower, and fuel consumption  
- Identification of variables with the strongest influence on fuel efficiency  
- Comparison of fuel consumption patterns across different vehicle types  

---

## Key Insights
- Engine size and vehicle weight show a strong positive relationship with fuel consumption  
- Higher horsepower is generally associated with lower fuel efficiency  
- Lighter vehicles tend to achieve better fuel economy  
- Multiple vehicle attributes collectively influence fuel consumption more effectively than single variables  

---

## Analytical and Business Applications
- Supports data-driven evaluation of vehicle efficiency  
- Helps identify design factors that impact fuel economy  
- Provides insights useful for cost optimization and environmental assessment  
- Demonstrates the application of predictive analytics in the automotive domain
